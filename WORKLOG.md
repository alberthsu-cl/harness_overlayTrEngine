# WORKLOG

This file is the persistent session handoff for the `harness/` project. Keep it short and restart-friendly.

## Current Objective

Milestone 1 acceptance is frozen in `MILESTONE1_ACCEPTANCE.md`. Milestone 2 retrieval coverage is complete. Milestone 3 rule-based single-pass flow is stable. Milestone 4 is focused on the video-backed transition analysis/report path.

## Last Completed

- Added deterministic transition progression fields to the analysis artifact.
- Kept `flow` and `analyze-sample-video` output aligned with the richer analysis artifact.
- Verified the focused flow and sample-video analysis tests pass.

## Next Implementation Step

Start the next Milestone 4 slice with a short checklist before changing behavior.

1. Pick the next deterministic transition-analysis gap.
2. List the affected modules and artifacts.
3. Add or update focused tests before the implementation.
4. Commit the slice and keep this worklog trimmed to recent items only.

## Why This Is Next

- Retrieval metadata and the rule-based analysis contract now flow through planning, run reports, top-level run output, plan-comparison reports, smoke-test batch summaries, the plan-job result payload, the `validate`/`prepare` command results, and the end-to-end `flow` and `sample-video` commands. Milestone 4 can build on that stable base.

## Resume Commands

Run from `D:\AI_Harness`:

```powershell
git -C harness status --short
git -C harness log --oneline -5
py -3 harness/src/main.py --help
```

Then inspect the likely implementation points:

```powershell
rg -n "plan-job|preset|mode|generated" harness/src/overlay_harness
Get-Content harness/src/overlay_harness/planner.py
Get-Content harness/src/overlay_harness/cli.py
```

## Working Notes

- Keep the catalog deterministic and JSON-stable.
- Prefer scanning checked-in source and project metadata over any runtime-only discovery.
- Keep this slice inside `harness/` unless the user explicitly asks to modify `overlaytrengine`.
- If future work needs FX naming conventions, registration changes, or generated source locations, ask before guessing as required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Model-backed analysis is deferred until the rule-based single-pass flow is finished and stable.
